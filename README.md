## Notes
- When installing libnotify in Gentoo, install mako first (or any wayland 
notification daemon). That way you won't have to install X dependencies.

- MPV has a lot of features I don't yet know.

### TODO
- [ ] Cook up a Rose-Pine yazi flavor
- [ ] Write systemd timers for updating package list in the git directory
      and clean symlinks from the user home directory.
- [ ] Git push kernel configs and portage config.
